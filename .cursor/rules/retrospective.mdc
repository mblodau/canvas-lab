# Retrospective Rule

## Purpose

This rule defines a retrospective process to evaluate how developer documentation was used during a task and improve it for future use.

## Trigger

When the user writes **"do a retro"**, perform a comprehensive retrospective on the current chat thread in relation to the developer documentation.

## Retrospective Process

### Three Key Questions

For each question, provide a detailed answer:

1. **Was the developer documentation considered?**
   - Check if dev docs were referenced and used during the task
   - Identify which sections were consulted
   - Note if dev docs were ignored or overlooked

2. **Was the developer documentation correct and did it help in your task?**
   - Evaluate accuracy of the documentation
   - Assess usefulness and clarity
   - Identify any gaps or misleading information
   - Note what worked well

3. **Does the developer documentation need to be updated with new changes from the accomplished task?**
   - Identify gaps or outdated information
   - Note new patterns or practices that emerged
   - Identify areas where documentation should be expanded
   - Note any inconsistencies between docs and implementation

### Improvement Process

For each question where the answer is **"no"** or **"partially"**:

1. **Reason about why**: Analyze why the documentation didn't work as expected
   - Was it missing information?
   - Was it unclear or confusing?
   - Was it outdated?
   - Was it in the wrong location?

2. **Improve the documentation**: Make concrete improvements so it works better next time
   - Add missing information
   - Clarify confusing sections
   - Update outdated content
   - Reorganize if needed
   - Add examples if helpful

### Action Items

After the retrospective:

1. **Update Developer Documentation**
   - Update `.cursor/docs/index.md` with:
     - Improvements and corrections
     - New information discovered during the retrospective
     - New patterns or practices
     - Clarifications and examples

2. **Update Changelog**
   - Fill in `.cursor/docs/CHANGELOG.md` with entries tracking:
     - **What changed**: Description of the documentation change
     - **Why**: Reason for the change (based on retrospective findings)
     - **When**: Timestamp/date of the change

### Changelog Format

Use a simple, readable format:

```markdown
## [Date] - [Brief Description]

### Changed

- What changed: [Description]
- Why: [Reason based on retrospective]
- When: [Timestamp]
```

## Example Retrospective Output

When triggered, provide:

1. Summary of the task completed
2. Answers to the three key questions
3. Analysis of issues found
4. Specific improvements made to documentation
5. Changelog entry created
