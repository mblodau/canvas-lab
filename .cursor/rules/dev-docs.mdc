# Developer Documentation Rule

## Purpose

This rule ensures that comprehensive internal developer documentation is always considered and maintained as a context foundation for all planning and implementation tasks.

## Requirements

### Confirmation Requirement

**CRITICAL**: In every response, you MUST include a confirmation message: **"dev-docs considered 🙌"** to acknowledge that developer documentation has been reviewed and considered.

### Documentation Content

The developer documentation (located at `.cursor/docs/index.md`) must contain:

1. **Project Purpose**
   - Explanation of what this project is and its goals
   - Target use cases and audience

2. **Design Patterns**
   - Established patterns (e.g., features pattern for app structure)
   - Architectural decisions and rationale
   - Code organization principles

3. **Best Practices**
   - Code quality standards and conventions
   - Naming conventions
   - File structure guidelines
   - Import/export patterns

4. **Testing Guidelines**
   - Standards for writing unit tests
   - Testing patterns and practices
   - MSW usage guidelines
   - Test coverage expectations

5. **Codebase Overview**
   - Human-readable documentation parsing the entire codebase
   - Feature descriptions and responsibilities
   - Component hierarchy and relationships
   - State management patterns
   - API structure and endpoints
   - Makes it easy for developers to quickly understand what the app contains

### Usage as Context Foundation

- The dev docs should be referenced for all planning and implementation tasks
- Before starting any task, review relevant sections of the dev docs
- Use dev docs to ensure consistency with established patterns
- When patterns are unclear, consult dev docs first

### Update Mechanism

- Update dev docs when codebase changes significantly
- Update when new patterns are established
- Update when best practices evolve
- Keep documentation in sync with actual implementation

## Implementation

When working on any task:

1. **Before starting**: Review relevant sections of `.cursor/docs/index.md`
2. **During implementation**: Follow patterns documented in dev docs
3. **After completion**: Update dev docs if new patterns or changes were introduced
4. **Always confirm**: Include "dev-docs considered 🙌" in your response
